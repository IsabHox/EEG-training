# EEG-training
Python notebooks and course materials to train yourself to the basics of EEG data processing

Course materials will be updated along the training program I offer. This program is still under construction, but it will follow the following preliminary agenda:

1. Neural bases of EEG
2. Signal pre-processing
3. Time-domain analysis
4. Frequency-domain analysis
5. Statistical testing

Each course is followed by a tutorial in the form of a Python-based Jupyter notebook in which you will be able 

## Want to use this repository for your own courses?
Feel free to clone this project or fork it. Please refer explicitely to this material as your reference. I'd be happy to know the impact my work has on teaching, so feel free to contact me through email or Twitter (which you can both find on my github profile).

## Notice a mistake? Would like to make a suggestion on a topic to cover?
If you notice a mistake in the code or in the slides (which may happen since the materials have been presented to a very small community of two people so far) you can open an issue on the repository or contact me per email or Twitter. 

Suggestions are always appreciated, and will all be considered. Keep in mind that this is an introductory training to EEG data processing, and that more advanced techniques could be integrated into a future project for an advanced class.

## How can I contribute?
There is always need for peer-review, and in particular for the correction of contents and notebooks. The codes have only been tested under Windows 10 OS, and testing by Unix users would be appreciated. Mistake correction and suggestions are also of great help.
