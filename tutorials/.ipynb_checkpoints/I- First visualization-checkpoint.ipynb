    "## Epoching the data\n",
    "In behavioral experiments, we usually observe the link between an element in the paradigm and the resulting brain activity. While recording the data, some time stamps are placed to store the moments at which experiment events ocurred. These stamps are called __markers__, and you may already have noticed them while visualizing the full time series: they are represented by vertical lines, with a label on top. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the current data, there are several types of markers:\n",
    "- these that indicate when the trial starts\n",
    "- these that indicate when the baseline period starts\n",
    "- these that indicate when the stimulus is displayed\n",
    "- these that mark the time of the participant's motor response\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful interpretation of neural data relies on the appropriate alignment of data. That is if we want to uncover a phenomenon that ocurrs say after a visual stimulus is displayed, it can be relevant to identify a temporal pattern that ocurrs systematically after the visual stimulus is presented. Hence, we want to compare segments of recordings which reflect the same behavior systematically, and we do that by cutting bits of equal size from data, from the same distance to a chosen marker. These recording segments are called __epochs__, and the \"slicing\" process is called __epoching__.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if you understood the use of epoching, try answering these questions:\n",
    "1. If I want to observe the neural correlates of motion in the current data, on which markers should I align the epochs?\n",
    "2. If I want to observe the sensory encoding (that is, the brain's response to the sensory stimulus that is provided), which markers should I use?"

    "In reality, it is common practise (for reasons that will become clearer in the next tutorial of this series) to extract epochs starting a small period of time before the marker. To explain shortly before we cover it in more detail later, this will allow to compute a change of activity compared to a state where we assume the brain is not performing any sort of task (this is sometimes called the __resting state__, and more accurately, we call this duration the __baseline__). The baseline usually lasts a few hundred milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the marker, when should you cut the data? That depends on the phenomenon you want to extract. You probably have asumptions about when your pattern should occur, based on neurophysiology or psychology. It is usually best to not extract epochs that are too short because you may be getting rid of relevant data, but not too long either in order to avoid overlapping epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, extract a list of markers corresponding to the stimulus (with `mne.events_from_annotations(eegdata)`). These markers are `10` and `20`. Then, try to extract epochs between 1 second before the markers \"stimulus\" (be careful, there are two different ones) and 3 seconds after these markers. Your epochs should therefore be 4 seconds long. Store your epochs in a variable called `ep`. "
